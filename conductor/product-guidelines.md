# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Primary Aesthetic:** **Cyber-Minimalist** meets **Architectural Structure**.
  - **Palette:** Deep void blacks (#050505), crisp whites for text, and electric neon accents (Blue/Emerald/Purple) derived from the AI ecosystem.
  - **Materials:** Heavy use of glassmorphism (backdrop-blur), thin subtle borders (1px white/10), and glowing gradients.
  - **Motion:** Physics-based, smooth, and continuous (orbits, floating elements) balanced with sharp, grid-aligned structural reveals.

## Typography
- **Headings:** Sans-serif, bold, tight tracking. Modern and digital-native (e.g., Geist Sans, Inter, or tailored system fonts).
- **Body:** Monospace for technical details (Geist Mono) mixed with highly readable sans-serif for narrative text.

## Tone of Voice
- **Primary Tone:** **Visionary Professionalism.**
  - The copy should bridge the gap between "hard engineering reliability" and "future-forward innovation."
  - Avoid overly casual slang. Use precise, strong verbs (e.g., "Architect," "Deploy," "Optimize").
  - **Example:** "High-performance execution for the next generation of web applications."

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
- **Performance First:** No animation should block the main thread. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) takes priority over decorative motion.
- **Discovery:** Information is revealed through interaction (hover states, expansion), rewarding user curiosity without overwhelming the initial view.
- **Accessibility:** Reduced motion preferences must be respected, offering a static but equally beautiful alternative to complex animations.
