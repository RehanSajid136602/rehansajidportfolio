Phase 0 — Execution Rules (important)

No random animations

No heavy libraries unless justified

Performance > flash

Animations must communicate hierarchy and flow

Mobile-first, desktop-enhanced

Phase 1 — Repository & Model Isolation (Setup Design)
Folder Strategy (MANDATORY)

Before touching code, execution will follow this structure:

/experiments/
  └─ /<MODEL_NAME>/
      └─ portfolio/
          ├─ (cloned repo)


Reason:

Keeps experiments reproducible

Allows model-by-model comparison

Prevents trashing main repo

Example model folder name:
gemini-3-pro or claude-sonnet-4.5

⚠️ This is execution-only, not done yet.

Phase 2 — Current State Analysis (What we must audit)
Areas to inspect

Tech stack

Framework (React / Next / Vite / etc.)

Styling (CSS / Tailwind / inline)

Animation libs (if any)

UX problems

Flat sections

No visual hierarchy

Abrupt transitions

Static scroll experience

Performance

Bundle size

Unnecessary re-renders

Heavy images

Animation jank

Branding

Weak hero section

No personal identity

No narrative flow

Deliverable (later):

Short audit report

“Keep / Improve / Replace” list

Phase 3 — New Architecture (High-Level Design)
Visual Structure (Pro layout)
Hero (identity + motion)
↓
About (story-driven)
↓
Skills (animated but restrained)
↓
Projects (interactive cards)
↓
Experience / Timeline
↓
Contact (conversion-focused)


Each section must:

Animate on entry

Have exit continuity

Respect scroll rhythm

Phase 4 — Animation System Design (Critical)
Animation Philosophy

❌ No random framer-motion everywhere
✅ One consistent animation language

Core rules

Entry: fade + translate (small distance)

Hover: scale OR lift, never both

Scroll: staggered, not simultaneous

Timing: 0.3–0.6s only

Tooling (decision later)

Options:

Framer Motion (controlled)

GSAP (only for complex timelines)

CSS + IntersectionObserver (lightweight)

Decision will be made after audit.

Phase 5 — Component-Level Improvements
1. Hero Section

Problems (likely):

Static text

Weak first impression

Planned upgrades:

Animated intro (name → role)

Subtle gradient / glow

Call-to-action with motion feedback

Risk: over-animation
Mitigation: strict limits

2. Skills Section

Upgrade plan:

Animated progress or tags

Grouped by category

Entry stagger

Avoid:

Fake percentages

Overloaded icons

3. Projects Section (Most important)

Upgrade plan:

Card-based layout

Hover reveal (tech stack, links)

Smooth expand / modal view

Animation intent:

“Explore” feeling, not carousel junk

4. Experience / Timeline

Upgrade plan:

Vertical animated timeline

Scroll-linked reveal

Clear progression

5. Contact Section

Upgrade plan:

Strong CTA

Motion feedback on input

Micro-interactions (focus, submit)

Phase 6 — Performance & Polish
Mandatory checks

Lighthouse score ≥ 90

Reduced motion support

Mobile animation throttling

Image optimization

Font loading strategy

Phase 7 — Testing Strategy
Functional

All links

Responsive breakpoints

Keyboard navigation

Visual

Animation overlaps

Layout shift

Scroll jitter

Phase 8 — Final Cleanup

Remove dead code

Comment non-obvious animations

Normalize animation tokens

README update (screenshots + live link)

Prioritized TODO List
Phase A — Preparation

 Decide model name folder

 Clone repo into isolated folder
Risk: low

Phase B — Audit

 Full UI/UX audit

 Performance baseline

 Animation opportunities list
Risk: medium (bad assumptions)

Phase C — Design

 Animation system definition

 Section-by-section redesign

 Tool selection
Risk: medium

Phase D — Implementation

 Hero animations

 Skills section

 Projects interactions

 Timeline

 Contact polish
Risk: high (scope creep)

Phase E — Optimization

 Performance pass

 Mobile tuning

 Reduced motion
Risk: low

Phase F — Review

 Visual QA

 Final refactor

 Cleanup
Risk: low

Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Over-animated UI	Strict animation rules
Performance drop	Measure before/after
Inconsistent style	Central animation config
Scope explosion	One section at a time
What happens NEXT (only after approval)

After you approve:

I will choose one model name

Clone repo into its folder

Start audit phase only

No code changes until audit is confirmed
